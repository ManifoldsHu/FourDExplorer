Using Reconstructed Images as Previews
======================================

Now that we finally have a reconstructed image, we can return to the 4D-STEM viewing page. Click the ``BROWSE PREVIEW`` button, and then select the reconstructed image we just created.

.. image:: /fig/BrowsePreview.png
   :alt: Browse Preview

After this, you can explore the 4D-STEM dataset in four-dimensional reciprocal space.

.. note::

   You may notice that a new image, ``gold_nanoparticle_06_preview.img``, has appeared under the ``gold_nanoparticle_06`` group. This is an empty placeholder image. Now that we have set the preview image to our reconstructed image, you can safely delete this empty image.
