Getting Started
==================

Welcome to the Getting Started section of the 4D-Explorer documentation. This section is designed to help you quickly get up and running with the 4D-Explorer software. Whether you are a new user or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will walk you through the essential steps to install, configure, and start using 4D-Explorer.

4D-Explorer is a powerful tool for analyzing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data. It provides a comprehensive suite of features for importing, managing, and visualizing 4D-STEM datasets, as well as performing advanced data reconstruction and calibration.

In this section, you will find detailed instructions on:

- **Data Management**: Get started with creating and managing HDF5 files and groups.
- **Importing 4D-STEM Datasets**: Learn how to import raw 4D-STEM datasets into HDF5 files.
- **Executing Tasks**: Understand how to monitor and manage tasks such as dataset import and reconstruction.
- **Viewing 4D-STEM Datasets**: Explore how to visualize 4D-STEM datasets and their diffraction patterns.
- **Reconstruction**: Learn how to perform data reconstruction, such as creating virtual images and ADF images.
- **Using Reconstructed Images as Previews**: Understand how to use reconstructed images to explore 4D-STEM datasets.

By the end of this section, you should have a solid understanding of how to use 4D-Explorer to analyze your 4D-STEM data effectively.
