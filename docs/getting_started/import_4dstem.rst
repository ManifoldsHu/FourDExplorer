Importing 4D-STEM Datasets
===========================

Now suppose we already have a binary 4D-STEM dataset file (a raw file) that we want to import into an HDF5 file. Select a group (or click on the root directory), right-click, and choose ``Import 4D-STEM Dataset``. This will open the dialog for loading a 4D-STEM dataset.

For the provided test dataset, choose ``EMPAD v0.51 (for NJU)``, then click the ``Browse`` button to select the EMPAD file we want to import (you should select the `.xml` file from the dataset folder).

Next, give the imported dataset a name, such as ``gold_nanoparticle_06``. Finally, click the ``OK`` button.

Follow the same steps to import the test datasets into the three groups, and assign the appropriate names to them.
