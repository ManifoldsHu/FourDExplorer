Importing 4D-STEM Dataset Collected by EMPAD
============================================

Before importing the dataset, you must first open an HDF5 file. In the main interface's menu bar, go to the ``Edit`` menu, find the ``Import 4D-STEM dataset`` button, and click it to open the import dialog. Alternatively, you can select any group from the file panel on the left side of the main interface, right-click, and choose ``Import 4D-STEM dataset`` from the menu.

In the pop-up import dialog, select ``EMPAD v1.0`` as the file type in the ``Import File Type`` field. Then, click the ``Browse`` button next to ``EMPAD XML file`` to select the EMPAD XML file you wish to import. Once the XML file is selected, the corresponding RAW file will automatically be located based on the XML file and will be filled in the ``EMPAD RAW file`` field. Afterward, in the ``Import Dataset to Location`` field, you can browse and select the group where you want to import the dataset. You can also specify the name of the dataset in the ``Name`` field.

.. note::

   When importing the provided test data, you should select ``EMPAD v0.51 (for NJU)``.
