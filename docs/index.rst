4D-Explorer Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the 4D-Explorer documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on using and contributing to the 4D-Explorer project.

4D-Explorer is a software designed for analyzing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data. It allows for the import, storage, correction, and reconstruction of 4D-STEM datasets and their metadata in real space. For an overview of 4D-STEM technology, see the review article by `Colin Ophus, 2019`__.

The documentation is organized into several sections:

- **Installation**: Detailed installation instructions for different platforms.
- **Test Dataset**: Description and usage of the provided test datasets for practice and demonstration.
- **Getting Started**: Instructions on how to install and begin using 4D-Explorer.
- **File and Data Operations**: Information on managing and manipulating HDF5 files and datasets.
- **Displaying Data**: Guides on how to visualize 2D images, vector fields, and other data types.
- **Reconstruction**: Methods and techniques for reconstructing images from 4D-STEM data.
- **Calibration**: Detailed steps on calibrating 4D-STEM datasets for accurate and quantitative imaging.

Please navigate through the sections using the table of contents below.

- **Project Repository**: The source code and issue tracker for 4D-Explorer can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/ManifoldsHu/FourDExplorer
