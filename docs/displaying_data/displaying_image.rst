Displaying 2D Image Data
========================

.. tip::
   Using the annular dark field image reconstructed from the ``gold_particle_06`` test dataset as an example.

In the dataset list on the left side of the interface, locate the 2D image (``.img`` data) you want to display, right-click, and select ``Open``. This will open a page displaying the image. On the right side of the page, the histogram of the image is shown.

   :alt: Adjust Viewing Data

Below the displayed image on the right, there are sliders and selection boxes that allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, data scale (``Norm``, linear or logarithmic), and color map of the image. In the image above, we adjusted the brightness, contrast, and changed the color map to ``plasma``. We also used the pan and zoom tools to drag and zoom in on a specific region of the image.
