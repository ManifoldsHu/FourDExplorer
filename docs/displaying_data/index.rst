Displaying Data
==================

4D-Explorer supports displaying various types of data, including 4D-STEM datasets, 2D images, and vector fields. The visualization is powered by the matplotlib library, which provides a wide range of plotting functionalities. The software includes a toolbar with buttons for adjusting image effects, such as zooming, panning, and configuring subplots. Additionally, users can customize the scale bar for accurate measurements and adjust the display settings for better visualization.

### Key Features

- **4D-STEM Data Display**: Visualize 4D-STEM datasets with interactive tools to explore diffraction patterns at different scan positions.
- **2D Image Display**: Display and adjust 2D images with options to modify brightness, contrast, and color mapping.
- **Vector Field Display**: Visualize vector fields with customizable arrow sizes and colors, and overlay background images for context.
- **Navigation Toolbar**: Utilize a toolbar with buttons for home, back, forward, zoom, magnifier, subplot configuration, subplot adjustment, save, and scale bar adjustment.
- **Scale Bar Customization**: Customize the scale bar for accurate measurements, with options to set length and units based on metadata or manually.
