Scale Bar
=========

Above the image display, there may be a toolbar with buttons that allow you to easily adjust the appearance of the image. Among these buttons, the rightmost one (depicted as a ruler) is the button for adjusting the scale bar.

Clicking this button opens a dialog. For 4D-STEM datasets and their exported images or vector fields that already have calibrated experimental parameters, the scale bar will automatically read these parameters and choose an appropriate length and display unit. In the pop-up dialog, you can also manually set the scale bar length in the given unit.

However, if the dataset lacks relevant metadata, the scale bar will use pixel count (``pix``) as the unit. In this case, you can check the ``Customize Scale`` option and manually enter the length of each pixel and the corresponding unit.

At the top of the dialog, there are two additional panels you can select: **Bar Style** and **Text Style**. These allow you to adjust the appearance of the scale bar and text, including settings for color, size, orientation, transparency, font, and more.
