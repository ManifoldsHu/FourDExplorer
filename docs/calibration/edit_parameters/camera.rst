Camera Parameters
==================

The **Camera** page contains parameters related to the camera. Among these, **Number of Pixels** refers to the number of pixels in the camera, and this value may not necessarily match the size of the diffraction images in the dataset (since we can crop or pad the diffraction images manually, but we cannot change the hardware film of the camera). The **Sensor Pixel Size** refers to the physical size of the camera pixels, which is the pixel size you could measure with a ruler if you physically removed the camera and examined it under a magnifying glass.
