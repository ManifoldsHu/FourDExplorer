General Parameters
==================

The first page is the **General** parameters page.

First, we can assign a title to the dataset. This title is different from the name stored in the HDF5 file; it is used solely for identification. In the **Dataset Title** field, it currently shows ``(None)``, indicating that the dataset metadata does not contain a title. You can click the corresponding ``Edit`` button to open the metadata editing dialog.

In the dialog, the **Item Path** field displays the dataset's path, while the **Metadata Key** field shows the key of the metadata we are editing. The **Value** field below is currently empty. Now, in the **Value** field, enter ``4D-Explorer Test Dataset`` or any other name of your choice, then click ``OK``. At this point, a warning dialog will appear, indicating that this is a predefined metadata key and advising caution when modifying it. Click ``OK`` again to confirm the modification.
