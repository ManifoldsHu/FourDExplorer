Microscope Parameters
======================

We can modify the metadata sequentially. After completing the first page (General) — and it's okay to leave some metadata fields blank — click the ``Next→`` button to move to the second page, which is the **Microscope** page. Here, you can enter information about the microscope, such as renaming it to ``Thermofisher FEI Titan G2 60-300``.

Next, several key parameters are available for editing, including **Beam Current**, **Accelerate Voltage**, **Camera Length**, **Convergence Angle** ($\alpha$), **Dwell Time**, and **Step Size**. These parameters are crucial for determining the quantitative analysis results of the dataset, so they must be modified with caution. Some parameters, like **Camera Length** and **Convergence Angle**, often require calibration using standard samples.

Here, we edit the **Convergence Angle**. For the test dataset ``gold_nanoparticle_06``, the convergence angle is 22.5 mrad, so in the **Value** field, we enter it using scientific notation as ``2.25 x 10^-2 rad``. Then click the ``OK`` button, and in the confirmation dialog that follows, click ``OK`` again.
