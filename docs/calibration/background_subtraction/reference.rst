Subtract Reference Method
=============================

On the opened page, the initial tab on the top right is **Subtract Reference**. Click the ``Browse`` button to search for a dataset in the HDF5 file with the ``.img`` extension to use as the background image to subtract. The size of this image must match the size of the diffraction images in the 4D-STEM dataset. 

Check the **Apply Background Subtraction** checkbox to display the result of the background subtraction in the center of the page. Once completed, click the red ``Start Background Subtraction`` button at the bottom of the page to open a dialog where you can set the output path for the resulting dataset.
