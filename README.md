4D-Explorer
-----------

4D-Explorer is a software to analyze four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data. It can import and save 4D-STEM datasets and their metadata, calibrate them and reconstruct images in real spaces. 

The software is still being constructed. Coming soon.
